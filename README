# Cows and Bulls: 15-112 Term Project

I made a [Cows and Bulls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows) game as my term project for [15-112: Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/).

This program is written in Python 3 and uses OpenCV 2 and k-NN classification for optical character recognition, pruning and decision trees for the game's AI, and sockets for multiplayer support.

You can find a demo of the project on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Io6sm2yQaxA).

### Dependancies

You will need the following packages installed for Python 3:

* `tkinter` for the GUI
* `PIL` for handling images
* `socket` for multiplayer mode
* `cv2` and `numpy` for OCR

### Use

To play the game, simply run `play.py` using `python3`.

### Features

The game currently supports:
* single-player mode (PvC) using set pruning for the game's artificial intelligence engine
* multiplayer mode (PvP) on the same device
* multiplayer mode (PvP) on multiple devices using sockets
* history and score views
* optical character recognition using a k-NN classification algorithm to allow the player to enter words through their webcam

This project can be improved in the following areas:
- [ ] adding dictionary checks to the PvP mode
- [ ] adding support for words in the PvC mode
- [ ] improving the GUI
- [ ] improving the OCR by training on larger character datasets
